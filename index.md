# Welcome!


I am an Associate Professor and Director of Graduate Studies at the Mathematics Department of Tulane University. Before 
joining Tulane in 2012, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor of Matehmatics at the University of Iowa from 2011 to 2012. 
Prior to that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Mathematical Biosciences Institute of the Ohio State University 
from 2009 to 2011. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2009. My B.S. and M.S. 
degrees were granted by the University of Science and Technology of China in 2001 and 2004, respectively.

I am generally interested in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The primary goal of my research is to 
understand the qualitative and quantitative properties of nonlienar PDE models, and how the properties can help interpret 
real world phenomena. My current research projects are tied to mathematical biology and fluid dynamics, giving priority to 
chemotaxis, geophyiscal, multi-phase and bio-fluid flows. Alongside mathematical research, I am also keen to educate 
and train young talents.
