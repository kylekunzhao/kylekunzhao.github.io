# Welcome!


  Test!!! I am an applied analyst. My research expertise is the analysis of nonlinear
   evolutionary partial differential equations motivated by problems in real
   world applications, such as porous media flows, traffic control systems,
   shallow water flows, geophysical fluid flows, multi-phase fluid flows,
   magnetohydrodynamics, bio-fluid flows, chemotaxis, solid tumor growth,
   cardiovascular flows, population dynamics, and epidemiology.
